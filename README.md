## Description 

This repository contains the manuscript entitled:
[**Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of git and GitHub**](https://github.com/ypriverol/github-paper/blob/master/document/manuscript.md). Our
aim here is to describe how the bioinformatics community can use
GitHub features and tools on a daily basis.

## Commenting and contributing 

We hope to finalise the manuscript and re-submit soon and won't accept
any new pull requests. Feel free to open an issue if there is any
point you would like to raise or discuss.

~~We are about to re-submit the manuscript after addressing the
reviewers' comments, but would appreciate input from the community by
discussing any points through GitHub
[issues](https://github.com/ypriverol/github-paper/issues) and/or pull
requests.~~

~~Feel free to browse through existing/past issues and if one seems
related, comment on it. If no existing issue seems appropriate, a new
issue can be opened to discuss the suggestion. In particular, we would
appreciate discussing more substantial changes (for example suggestion
of new rules) in a dedicated issue before sending a pull request.~~

~~If you are new to Git, read the
[manuscript](https://github.com/ypriverol/github-paper/blob/master/document/manuscript.md)
and
[*A Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub*](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668) -
your input would be most valuable.~~

~~If, based on your contribution, you would like to be added as a
co-author, please open an issue and provide your name and affiliation
and a short description of your contribution or a link to the relevant
